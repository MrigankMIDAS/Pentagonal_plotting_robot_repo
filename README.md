# Pentagonal_plotting_robot_repo
This repo contains the Inverse Kinematics and Forward Kinematics of a 5 bar parallel Linkage robot with 2  degree of freedom which operates in a 2d plane. It is used with a magnetic board to plot various shapes. The robot takes a sequence of points as input and goes from 1 point to next in a straight line.
